# This script works on a theme that was started by copying T S _ G R I D.
# If the theme still has the name ts_grid sprinkled throughout, this does the
# job of changing those instances of 'ts_grid' to the new theme name.
# This script goes through the current directory and replaces instances with the new
# theme name and does so in place. (Does _not_ create a new directory or a new copy.)
# It also renames the directory from ts_grid to the new theme name if it is
# not already re-named.
#
# call like this:
# > cd theme/directory
# > update_theme_name.sh my_new_theme_name
